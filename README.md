twitter_scraper
===============

This is a twitter scraping script that allows me to gather data regarding my clothing app.

Why?
----
Because I need hard data to motivate feature selection for Impress.

How?
----
Using Twitter's free search API and some data crunching in Python, along with storage... Somewhere...

What?
-----
I need to collect:
1. Users that match selection criteria (like to shop for clothes, talk about brands, tweet about selfies, etc.)
2. The selection criteria for which they were selected
3. All of their tweets.  Forever.
Collecting these users and their tweets will hopefully give me a sufficiently large population that is sufficiently part of my target audience to give me greater insight and concrete data about what features they want/enjoy/etc.
Also in theory, given a sufficiently large population, I should be able to select only users that match more selection criteria, placing them closer to the center and giving me higher confidence of their likelihood to want Impress.
Who?

Feel free to contribute Bill :P
